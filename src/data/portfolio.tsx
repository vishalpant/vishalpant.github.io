    description: `I'm a Cloud and DevOps Engineer who enjoys making complex systems run smoothly. I love taking manual, repetitive, or unreliable processes and turning them into something fast, automated, and scalable.

    Most of my work lives in the AWS, Azure, and Kubernetes ecosystem — designing cloud architectures, managing Infrastructure as Code(Terraform), and building reliable CI/ CD pipelines that help teams deliver faster with confidence.

    I'm comfortable working across multiple programming languages and tools — whether it's Python, Go(Golang), or whatever best fits the problem.I use code to automate infrastructure, streamline deployments, and create tools that make engineering teams more productive and systems more reliable.

    I've also built an MCP(Model Context Protocol) server, which deepened my interest in how AI and DevOps can come together to create smarter, adaptive infrastructure.I'm always exploring new ideas in containerization, serverless computing, and cloud - native automation frameworks to push the boundaries of what's possible.

    For me, DevOps isn't just about tools or pipelines — it's about building trust through reliability, collaboration, and continuous improvement.I enjoy connecting with people who are curious, creative, and passionate about solving meaningful problems — in tech or beyond.`,
